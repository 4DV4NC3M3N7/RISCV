Warning (18236): Number of processors has not been specified which may cause overloading on shared machines.  Set the global assignment NUM_PARALLEL_PROCESSORS in your QSF to an appropriate value for best performance.
Critical Warning (332012): Synopsys Design Constraints File file not found: 'quarter.sdc'. A Synopsys Design Constraints File is required by the Timing Analyzer to get proper timing constraints. Without it, the Compiler will not properly optimize the design.
Info (332144): No user constrained base clocks found in the design
Info (332096): The command derive_clocks did not find any clocks to derive.  No clocks were created or changed.
Warning (332068): No clocks defined in design.
Info (332143): No user constrained clock uncertainty found in the design. Calling "derive_clock_uncertainty"
Info (332154): The derive_clock_uncertainty command did not apply clock uncertainty to any clock-to-clock transfers.
